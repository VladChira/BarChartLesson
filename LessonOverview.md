# Creating a bar chart in Python with seaborn


## Introduction
In many real-life situations, we will need to visualize a particular dataset in order to extract meaningful information, especially if the dataset is large. One of the ways in which data can be visualized is with charts. Bar charts are commonly used in real life, in applications such as: business analytics, survery results, student performance etc.

In this lesson, we will be creating a **bar chart** in Python with the [**seaborn**](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) data visualization library. This is the chart that we should have hopefully created by the end:

## Prerequisites

### Difficulty: 2/5
This lesson is of easy difficulty. You are expected to be at least slightly familiar with the Python programming language, working with a terminal window and have basic knowledge of the dictionary data structure. The rest will be fully explained.

### Lesson format
Each step will have detailed instructions for you to follow, as well as challenges that you will need to complete on your own. If you are stuck, the solution is provided in a separate file.

### Lesson objectives
By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:
- Load and prepare simple datasets before using them
- Create different bar charts using the dataset
- Customize the look and feel of the charts 

### Dependencies
For this lesson, you will need to have Python 3.9+ and other Python packages installed. Please refer to [Step 1](./Step1/) for installation steps.

### Dataset
In this lesson we will use the [Video Game Sales with Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) dataset for our visualization. A copy of the dataset in .csv format is already included here. However, feel free to use any dataset you want to create your own beautiful charts.
